# Lava Hop!

What's special about this game is that it's my first game where I wrote 0 lines of code. Like, _actually_, ze-ro ðŸ¤¯. I just put down $20 to see what claude code could do with wasm4. 

This took me about 2 hours of intense vibe-coding. See also what the game looked like [at the 1 hour mark](https://canyonturtle.github.io/lava-hop/old.html).

See [source code here](https://github.com/canyonturtle/lava-hop).
